## Node.js Overview

### REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
The Node.js REPL allows you to interact with the Node.js environment in real-time. You can enter JavaScript code, evaluate it, and get immediate results. To start the REPL, just enter `node` in your command line or terminal.

### Node.js Standard Library
The Node.js standard library offers a rich set of built-in modules that provide various functionalities, such as working with the file system, creating HTTP servers, and more.

### Web API
Node.js can interact with web APIs to build server-side applications, allowing you to create RESTful services, work with databases, and more.

### Modules
In Node.js, modules are used to organize and share code. To import or export modules, you don't always need to use the `.mjs` extension, but it's a common practice for ES modules. This extension indicates the file contains ES module syntax. For CommonJS modules, the standard file extension is `.js`.

### Require Function
The `require` function is used to import modules in Node.js. By default, it expects filenames with the `.js` extension. However, it can also import JSON files or native modules with different extensions.

### Global Asynchronous Behavior
Global asynchronous code using modules with the `.mjs` extension is asynchronous by default, following the ES module standard. If you're using `.js` files for CommonJS modules, you must add asynchronous behavior with an `async` function or callbacks.

### OS (Operation Systems)
Node.js provides the `os` module to interact with the operating system. It can retrieve information about the system's platform, memory, CPU, and more.

### Path
The `path` module in Node.js is part of the standard library and is used for working with file and directory locations. It provides functions to resolve file paths, join directories, and handle cross-platform differences in file structures.

### File System
The `fs` (File System) module in Node.js is a standard library used to manipulate the file system. It provides a variety of operations to interact with files and directories, including reading, writing, and deleting. The library offers three types of operations:
- **Synchronous:** These methods block program execution until the operation is complete.
- **Asynchronous using Callbacks:** These methods allow the program to continue running while the file operation is in progress, notifying when complete through a callback function.
- **Asynchronous using Promises:** These methods return Promises, offering a cleaner approach to asynchronous operations.

### Debugger
To run code in debug mode with Node.js, you need to use a specific command-line flag. By default, files with the `.js` extension don't run in debug mode. To enable debugging, use the `inspect` flag:
```bash
node --inspect filename.js
